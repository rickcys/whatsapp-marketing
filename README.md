# WhatsApp Marketing
WhatsApp offers you a more personal conversation with your customers as its ad free. You can send across the pitch directly in their inboxes and information about products they might have purchased from you such as delivery date, invoice etc. All this being said Facebook owns WhatsApp; therefore, we should recognize how powerful this platform has become by looking at its statistics: 1600 million people use WhatsApp worldwide (including 500+ active user accounts within India) which amounts to over half of one percent population-wide and makes messaging via mobile phone an important aspect today’s social media landscape.

You can use WhatsApp’s group chat feature to form targeted friendships. This means that only those people who interact positively with your content will be in the group, giving you an exclusive opportunity for feedback and interaction. When reaching out through text messages or multimedia message types like GIFS videos audios etc., we recommend communicating via voice call if at all possible because it is built into this app but don’t worry about being too distant from customer base while they’re browsing online; there are ways around being cut off entirely thanks so much its multi-device compatibility which allows users access anywhere.

The many features of WhatsApp make it a great marketing tool for businesses and entrepreneurs. A key feature is group chats, which allow you to create focused groups with only those contacts who interact positively in your content this way there’s no need whatsoever spend time responding or dealing directly with people negativity and you can just ignore them.
